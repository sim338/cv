      <p>I was an Estimator for 22 years, this was an experience but a
        painful one which I mostly regret, thats not to say I haven't benefited from a reasonable
        salary over the years which have thankfully paid my bills and supported the upbringing of my
        two children. I am however now looking for a career <strong>I WANT</strong>, a career I can build on through honest interest
        and passion for the subject, after attempting to escape from my career in print on several
        occasions I finally managed it through voluntary redundancy in 2020 (the tragic year
        of covid 19). Now, via bouts of motivation, I am attempting to learn the skill of
        Front End Web Development on my own accord, this has thus far been difficult but I intend on fighting my way through to
        a career I can be proud of.</p></td>
